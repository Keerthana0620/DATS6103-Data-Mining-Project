Project Description:
People are always confused about their medical insurance and don't know the cost of
insurance at different ages and conditions.
This project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates health insurance premiums
for individuals based on a range of demographic and medical history factors. This helps
insurance providers and policyholders understand how different factors influence
insurance premiums and to predict future premium changes.
